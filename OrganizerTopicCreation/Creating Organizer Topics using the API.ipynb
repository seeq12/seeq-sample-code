    "Algorithmically creating topics using Seeq's REST API can be done using any programming language.  This tutorial will walk through creating these object using Python 2.7 and Seeq's SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial will show how to create a new Organizer containing a new Topic and modifying the text shown in the topic.  Once this has been accomplished, I recommend that you check out the _Embedding Metrics and Trends using the API_ tutorial to see how to create and include Seeq content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that doing these kinds of operations through the API circumvents all of the front-end's safety checks.  It is **highly recommended** that you develop on a local machine and test all code thoroughly **before using your code on an active server**. You should probably also **back that server up**. As an example of what can go wrong, forgetting the `\"`'s in the `workbook_input.data` JSON will render the server unreachable by all...and potentially unfixable!\n"
