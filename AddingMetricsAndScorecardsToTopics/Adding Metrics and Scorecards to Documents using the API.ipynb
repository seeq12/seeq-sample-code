    "Algorithmically creating metrics and scorecards using Seeq's REST API can be done using any programming language.  This tutorial will walk through creating these object using Python 2.7 and Seeq's SDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial assumes that you know how to create Worksheets and Topics using the API (see the tutorial _Creating Organizer Topics using the API_) and will focus on creating Metrics and Scorecards which will then be added to an existing Topic Document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that doing these kinds of operations through the API circumvents all of the front-end's safety checks.  It is **highly recommended** that you develop on a local machine and test all code thoroughly **before using your code on an active server**. You should probably also **back that server up**. As an example of what can go wrong, forgetting the `\"`'s in the `workbook_input.data` JSON will render the server unreachable by all...and potentially unfixable!\n"
