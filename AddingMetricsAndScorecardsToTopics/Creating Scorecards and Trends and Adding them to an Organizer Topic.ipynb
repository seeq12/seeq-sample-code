    "\n",
    "The tutorial will show how to create a new Organizer containing a new Topic and modifying the text shown in the topic.  Once this has been accomplished, I recommend that you check out the _Embedding Metrics and Trends using the API_ tutorial to see how to create and include Seeq content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that doing these kinds of operations through the API circumvents all of the front-end's safety checks.  It is **highly recommended** that you develop on a local machine and test all code thoroughly **before using your code on an active server**. You should probably also **back that server up**. As an example of what can go wrong, forgetting the `\"`'s in the `workbook_input.data` JSON will render the server unreachable by all...and potentially unfixable!\n"

It boils down to creating the desired content using the appropriate endpoint (only required when making the metric), setting Worksteps to show the content you want, then creating screenshots of those Worksteps.

    "Seeq content in Topic documents has a specific format, with custom html attributes.  To fill in the attributes, I'm going to create a Jinja2 template.  Typically these templates are hosted in external html files, but we'll create one from a string for clarity.  In addition to the attributes, we want a link to our image's source data to enable drill-down functionality, so I need to create a link to the source Worksheet.  Note that I create a new UUID for the image when I embed it.  This is for frontend content tracking."

One useful method of understanding the effects of different operations is to use a diff tool (e.g., Meld) to examine changes made to the data store between operations.\n",
